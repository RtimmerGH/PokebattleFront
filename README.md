# PokebattleFront
this is the repo for the Front app of Pokebattle 

This repo contains the front part of the project I developped during the Wild Code School Checkpoint 4 in February 2023.
I chose to work on a small game about Pokemon.
Checkpoint lasted 2 days and I worked 2 more days to improve design, add features, fix bugs and deploy the app.
Front has been done with React and TailwindCSS.

Application is available below:
